Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Softare engineering is the designing, developing, maintanance of software systems that ensure that the end product meets the users requirements.
- It is important because the field continues to push boundaries and explore new frontiers in software development, and its paving the way for groundbreaking advancements in many industries.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Structured Programming (1960s)
- Waterfall Model (1970s)
- Agile Methodologies (Early 2000s)
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning: Define the projects goal
- Requirements analysis: Gather and analyze the requirements of the project
- Design: The creation of the application's architecture, framework and prtotypes
- Coding: Develop the application's code
- Testing: Make sure the application is running as it was intended
- Deployment: Make the application available for use
- Maintanance: Improve the application continuosly
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process with distict phases whereas Agile uses an iterative approach with continuous feedback loops.
- When to use Waterfall: Projects that have require detailed documentation
                        : Projects that have a high level of predictability amd low risks
- When to use Agile: Projects that require high customer involvement and collaboration
                   : Projects with evolving requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- The developer writes the code and develops the entire software product.
- The QA engineers perform tests on thr code to guarantee high quality product to the end user
- Assign tasks, evaluate the teams performance and provide guidance throughout the entire process
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- They are important because they enhance developer productivityt by streamlining code editing and tracking changes made to the team overtime.
- VS Code, PyCharm, Netbeans
- Github, Bitbucket, Helix Core
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Limited infrastructure, tight deadlines and keeping up with technology.
- Adopt continuous learning practices.
- Effective time management strategies are essential
- They must rely on robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: Tests individual units of code in isolation to ensure their correctness.
- Integration testing: Tests how different units interact with each other
- System testing: Tests the entire software application as a whole under many conditions to verify fuctionality and requirements.
- Acceptance: Evaluates the software from the user's perspective to ensure it meets business needs and is ready to be deployed

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
